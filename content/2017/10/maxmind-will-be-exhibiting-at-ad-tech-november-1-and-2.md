stick around for a speech hosted by our Director of Business Development Jenn
Sessler.

Jenn will be on stage at the Spotlight Theatre on the Expo Floor Wednesday,
November 1 at 12:10 and will be joined by Arun Gupta, U.S. Sales Director for
[Adjust](https://www.adjust.com/working-with-adjust/?utm_channel=1&utm_source=google&utm_medium=search&utm_term=mobile%20analytics%20adjust&utm_content=noForm&utm_campaign=adjust_DT_US&_bk=adjust&_bt=190898160410&_bm=e&_bn=g&gclid=EAIaIQobChMI19vNvfSE1wIVCVmGCh17qgiKEAAYASAAEgIjWPD_BwE),
to talk about the challenges of marketing to anonymous users. Jenn and Arun will
discuss the dangers of “affiliate fraud” and “click fraud” and reveal how
companies can identify anonymous web traffic to deliver targeted advertising to
“good” customers while avoiding the bad guys. Attendees will learn the ways
advertisers can save money by reducing their cost per impression and cost per
lead KPIs and how to utilize e-commerce traffic patterns to validate legitimate
customers and leads.

The speech is titled "Anonymizers and IP Intelligence: Making the Most of
Location." You can find out more about the speech by visiting
