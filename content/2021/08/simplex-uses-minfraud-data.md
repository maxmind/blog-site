[Simplex](https://www.simplex.com/) has been changing the status quo of crypto
purchases since 2014. As the market leader, they pioneered the first riskless
global fiat onramp using a credit and debit card, which promises a zero
chargeback guarantee. With a zero chargeback guarantee in place, there's a lot
at stake in fraud detection and prevention. When they were putting together
their platform, they knew from the beginning that they would need an agile,
responsive algorithm at the heart of their fraud detection and prevention
solutions. Simplex Data Analyst Talor Kars works closely with that algorithm.

For the analysts who work on Simplex’s fraud detection algorithm, data is key to
a responsive algorithm. They decided to implement minFraud because, in addition
to a risk score, the
[minFraud Insights service](https://www.maxmind.com/en/solutions/minfraud-services)
gave them access to a breadth of high quality data on
[inputs ranging from IP geolocation and email risk to financial institution data](https://www.maxmind.com/en/solutions/minfraud-services/data-points#outputs),
all via a flexible easy-to-use API.

The variety of data available through minFraud Insights allows Simplex to track
patterns across many different data points. Rather than trying to anticipate
which data points will be most relevant to fraud, Simplex can feed the breadth
of minFraud data into their algorithm, allowing it to identify and adapt to
patterns in fraud as they emerge. This adaptability is key to fighting fraud in
the rapidly changing crypto industry.

> “We also make minFraud data available to our fraud analysts for manual review
> of transactions.”

The data from minFraud Insights also helps Simplex to dig into particular claims
of fraud, allowing their fraud prevention specialists to avoid erroneous
chargebacks and investigate issues thoroughly when they arise. When a customer
claims that a transaction is fraudulent, Simplex fraud investigators can check
the details of their customer’s story against the data returned by minFraud, to
confirm their story or ask more questions if the data and the story don’t seem
to line up.

Along with a powerful algorithm, Simplex’s analysts use minFraud Insights data
to protect the integrity of their clients’ transactions and reduce costs due to
chargebacks. In the end, whether they’re building a fraud detection algorithm or
manually reviewing transactions, it all comes down to the data.
