In order to better ensure that out-of-date IP data is not being used, MaxMind
will no longer allow customers to continue to download old GeoIP and GeoLite
databases once their subscription expires. This will help us to ensure
compliance with digital privacy laws, protecting our business and yours.

This change will come into effect on February 8, 2021. No action is required on
the part of customers.

In the past, we have allowed customers to continue to download databases past
their subscription date as a courtesy, removing access only when the latest
version of the databases they have paid for are 30 days old. Moving forward,
customers will not be able to download paid databases once their subscription
has expired. By removing access to these databases, we are working to ensure
that only the latest versions of our databases, which regularly incorporate
critical updates, corrections, and changes based on digital privacy rights, are
being used in production.
