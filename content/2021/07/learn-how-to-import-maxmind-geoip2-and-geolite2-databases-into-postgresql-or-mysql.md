We’ve added documentation to our developer’s site giving a tutorial on how to
import the CSV versions of our GeoIP2 and GeoLite2 databases into PostgreSQL and
MySQL. In addition to the basic information about how to bring MaxMind’s data
into these popular database frameworks, we have also included pointers from our
dev team on how to index and organize them for faster searching.

You can import GeoIP2 and GeoLite2 data into your database in order to more
easily manipulate and transform the data, or join and link the data with other
datasets.Check out the tutorials for
[PostgreSQL](https://dev.maxmind.com/geoip/importing-databases/postgresql?lang=en)
and [MySQL](https://dev.maxmind.com/geoip/importing-databases/mysql?lang=en) on
our
[developer’s site](https://dev.maxmind.com/geoip/importing-databases?lang=en).
