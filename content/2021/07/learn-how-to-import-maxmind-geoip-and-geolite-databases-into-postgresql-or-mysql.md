We've added documentation to our developer's site giving a tutorial on how to
import the CSV versions of our GeoIP and GeoLite databases into PostgreSQL and
MySQL. In addition to the basic information about how to bring MaxMind's data
into these popular database frameworks, we have also included pointers from our
dev team on how to index and organize them for faster searching.

You can import GeoIP and GeoLite data into your database in order to more easily
manipulate and transform the data, or join and link the data with other
datasets.Check out the tutorials for
[PostgreSQL](https://dev.maxmind.com/geoip/importing-databases/postgresql/) and
[MySQL](https://dev.maxmind.com/geoip/importing-databases/mysql/) on our
[developer’s site](https://dev.maxmind.com/geoip/importing-databases/).
