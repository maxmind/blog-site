Want to create a map of where your users are? With the GeoIP processor, you can
easily
[attach the location of your users to your user metrics](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.10/geoip-processor.html).

Right out of the box, Kibana can map this traffic immediately by country or
country subdivision:

Plus, the new
[User Experience](https://www.elastic.co/blog/introducing-user-experience-monitoring-app-synthetic-capabilities)
app for Elastic APM automatically creates maps based on monitoring data:

But what if you want to take this one step further and create maps with
different regions?

<!--lint disable no-heading-punctuation-->

## Custom regions: metro area, proximity to IKEA, anything...

Elastic Maps come with a lot of great region options so you can get started
quickly, but it also offers the ability to **easily map your own regions**. You
can use any boundary data you'd like for this, as long as you have source data
that contains a longitude and latitude.

For this example, suppose we use GeoIP, which is built into Elasticsearch. GeoIP
is a common way of transforming an IP address to a longitude and latitude.

GeoIP is roughly accurate on the city level globally and neighborhood level in
selected countries. Itâ€™s not as great as an actual GPS location from your phone,
but itâ€™s much more precise than just a country, state, or province. So thereâ€™s a
lot of resolution between the precision of the longitude and latitude from GeoIP
and the default maps you get in Kibana.

This level of detail can be very useful for driving decision-making. For
example, say you want to spin up a marketing campaign based on the locations of
your users or show executive stakeholders which metro areas you see are
experiencing an uptick of traffic.

<!--lint disable no-emphasis-as-heading-->

_GeoIP databases contain latitude and longitude coordinates located near the
center of the region or subdivision in which the IP address is located. If you
rely on longitude and latitude data from IP geolocation, this may sometimes give
misleading results. For example, if GeoIP has identified that an IP address is
in the United States, but MaxMind doesn't have data on which state the IP
address is in, it will return longitude and latitude near the geographic center
of the United States (e.g., Kansas)._

_GeoIP's longitude and latitude data can be combined with its `accuracy_radius`
data to help combat false confidence in its geolocation coordinates._

_You can learn more about
[the accuracy of GeoIP on our Support Center](https://support.maxmind.com/hc/en-us/articles/4407630607131-Geolocation-Accuracy)._

That kind of scale in the United States is often captured with what the Census
Bureau calls the Combined Statistical Area (CSA). It is roughly equivalent with
how people intuitively think of which urban area they live in. **It does not
necessarily coincide with state or city boundaries.**

This subdivision is central to many of the Federal Governmentâ€™s policies, such
as making cost-of-living adjustments to fiscal benefits. CSAs generally share
the same telecom providers and ad networks. New fast food franchises expand to a
CSA rather than a particular city or municipality. Basically, people in the same
CSA shop in the same IKEA.

Assigning a spatial identifier to a feature based on its location is called
**reverse geocoding** or **spatial joining**. Itâ€™s one of the most common
operations in geographic information systems (GIS).

In the Elastic Stack, this reverse-geocoding functionality resides within
Elasticsearch via the `enrich` processor. Here we're going to use Kibana to
manage these processors and then create maps and visualizations. In the tutorial
below, we will use CSA boundaries to illustrate reverse geocoding.

## Reverse geocoding with the Elastic Stack

### Step 1: Indexing the geospatial data

This will probably be the most custom part of any solution, so weâ€™ll skip it ðŸ˜œ.
Most integrations can rely on the
[GeoIP processor](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.10/geoip-processor.html)
to transform an IP location into a `geo_point` field.

Whatever process you have used to index your data, youâ€™ll have a document using
the [ECS schema](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/ecs/current/ecs-geo.html) that
will contain two sets of fields created by the GeoIP processor:

- destination.geo.\* for where requests are going (usually a data center)
- client.geo.\* for the origin of the request, sometimes called`origin.geo.*`.

The relevant bit here is that `*.geo.location` field. It contains the
**longitude** and **latitude** of the device.

For the rest of this tutorial, weâ€™ll use the `kibana_sample_data_logs` index
that comes with Kibana, since thatâ€™s quicker to follow along with. The critical
part for reverse geocoding is the presence of the longitude/latitude information
and less _how_ that longitude/latitude field was created.

### Step 2: Indexing the boundaries

To get the CSA boundary data, download the
[Cartographic Boundary shapefile (.shp)](https://www.census.gov/geographies/mapping-files/time-series/geo/carto-boundary-file.html)
from the Census Bureauâ€™s website.

To use it in Kibana, we need it as a GeoJSON format. I used QGIS to convert it
to GeoJSON. Check out this
[helpful tutorial](https://gist.github.com/YKCzoli/b7f5ff0e0f641faba0f47fa5d16c4d8d)
if you'd like to do the same.

Once you have your GeoJSON file, go to Maps in Kibana and upload the data using
the
[GeoJSON uploader](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/kibana/7.10/indexing-geojson-data-tutorial.html).

Zoomed in on the result, we get a sense of what exactly constitutes a metro area
in the eyes of the Census Bureau. I added some tooltip fields using the
**Tooltip Fields** in the layer editor.

![](/images/2021/03/blog-custom-map-boundaries-3-1024x513.jpg)

This upload created our CSA index containing the shapes weâ€™ll use for reverse
geocoding.

### Step 3: Reverse geocoding with a pipeline

In order to create our pipeline, we first need to create the reverse geocoder.
We can do this by
[creating a geo_match enrichment policy](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.10/geo-match-enrich-policy-type.html).

Run the following from Dev Tools in Kibana:

```json
// PUT /_enrich/policy/csa\_lookup
{
  "geo_match": {
    "indices": "csa",
    "match_field": "coordinates",
    "enrich_fields": ["GEOID", "NAME"]
  }
}
```

```json
// POST /_enrich/policy/csa_lookup/_execute
```

This creates an enrich policy called `csa_lookup`. It uses the `coordinates`
field which contains the shapes (it has a `geo_shape` field-type). The policy
will enrich other documents with the `GEOID` and `NAME` fields. It also
automatically attaches the `coordinates` field. The `_execute` call is required
for initializing the policy.

Then weâ€™ll integrate this reverse-geocoder into a pipeline.

```json
// PUT /_ingest/pipeline/lonlat-to-csa
{
  "description": "Reverse geocode longitude-latitude to combined statistical area",
  "processors": [
    {
      "enrich": {
        "field": "geo.coordinates",
        "policy_name": "csa_lookup",
        "target_field": "csa",
        "ignore_missing": true,
        "ignore_failure": true,
        "description": "Lookup the csa identifier"
      }
    },
    {
      "remove": {
        "field": "csa.coordinates",
        "ignore_missing": true,
        "ignore_failure": true,
        "description": "Remove the shape field"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

Our pipeline consists of two processors:

<!--lint disable ordered-list-marker-value-->

1. The first is the `enrich` processor we just created. It references our
   `csa_lookup` policy. It creates a new field `csa` that contains the CSA
   identifiers (GEOID, NAME) and the CSA geometry (coordinates).
1. The second is a `remove` processor that removes the CSA geometry field. (We
   donâ€™t need it since we are only interested in the identifiers).

### Step 4: Running the pipeline on all your documents

Now that the pipeline is created, we can start using it. And a great thing about
pipelines is **you can run them on your existing data**.

With
[\_reindex](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.10/docs-reindex.html#reindex-with-an-ingest-pipeline),
you can create a new index with a copy of your newly enriched documents:

```json
// POST \_reindex
{
  "source": {
    "index": "kibana_sample_data_logs"
  },
  "dest": {
    "index": "dest",
    "pipeline": "lonlat-to-csa"
  }
}
```

With
[\_update_by_query](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.10/docs-update-by-query.html#docs-update-by-query-api-ingest-pipeline),
all the documents are enriched in place:

```json
// POST kibana\_sample\_data\_logs/\_update\_by\_query?pipeline=lonlat-to-csa
```

### Step 5: Running the pipeline on new documents at ingest

All the existing docs are updated. Now we need to make sure we also use this
pipeline when indexing new documents:

```json
// POST kibana\_sample\_data\_logs/\_doc/testdoc?pipeline=lonlat-to-csa
{
  "geo": {
    "coordinates": {
      "lon": -85.7585,
      "lat": 38.2527
    }
  }
}
```

Let's test it out:

```json
// GET kibana_sample_data_logs/_doc/testdoc
```

You can also setup a default pipeline to have this reverse geocoding done for
each incoming document by default:

```json
// PUT kibana_sample_data_logs/_settings
{
  "index": {
    "default_pipeline": "lonlat-to-csa"
  }
}
```

### Step 6: Creating a map

Back in the Maps app, click **Add layer**. Then select **Choropleth Layer**:

![](/images/2021/03/blog-custom-map-boundaries-4.png)

Weâ€™ll select our CSA -layer (these are the shapes), and join them by the unique
`GEOID` identifier. Then weâ€™ll join the aggregate info from our request index.
The join field here is `csa.GEOID`, which was created by the pipeline.

After changing the default color ramp from green to red and adding some tooltip
fields, we can now create our map. In this case, it shows a few hotspots in the
Dallas, Indianapolis, and New York metropolitan areas.
