We are happy to announce the release of the GeoLite2 web service, a limited free
IP geolocation API. You may use up to 1000 look-ups per day for the GeoLite2 web
service.

Since 2002 MaxMind has been trusted by hundreds of thousands of developers to
provide IP geolocation data for projects of passion to enterprise-grade
applications and everything in between.

We’ll keep this brief: _why should you use the GeoLite2 web service?_

- **Reliability.**
    We have been at this for 18 years and our web service infrastructure serves
    tens of billions of requests annually with 99.99% uptime.
- **Accuracy.**
    We know that IP geolocation has its limitations and we strive to be as
    transparent as possible about our [accuracy
    numbers](https://www.maxmind.com/en/geoip2-city-accuracy-comparison) for
    both our free and paid solutions.
- **Accessibility.** [Our APIs are public](https://dev.maxmind.com/geoip/) and
    widely adopted which is why you have probably seen MaxMind integrated in
    some of the platforms you use, and probably why you know about us.
- **Flexibility.**
    If you need more accurate or other kinds of IP data all you need to do is
    switch out the URL  to call one of our [paid web
    services](https://www.maxmind.com/en/geoip2-precision-services). We don’t
    require a subscription or commitment. You can pay as you go and service
    credits don’t expire.

**To sign up for GeoLite2, head over to our [GeoLite2
page](https://dev.maxmind.com/geoip/geoip2/geolite2/).**

If you’re an existing GeoLite2 database user, you can generate a license key and
start using the service immediately. Our [GeoIP2 Precision web service client
APIs](https://dev.maxmind.com/geoip/geoip2/web-services/) may be used with the
GeoLite2 web services.
