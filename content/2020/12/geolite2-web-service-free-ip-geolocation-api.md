We are happy to announce the release of the GeoLite2 web service, a limited free
IP geolocation API. You may use up to 1000 look-ups per day for the GeoLite2 web
service.

Since 2002 MaxMind has been trusted by hundreds of thousands of developers to
provide IP geolocation data for projects of passion to enterprise-grade
applications and everything in between.

We’ll keep this brief: _why should you use the GeoLite2 web service?_

- **Reliability.** We have been at this for 18 years and our web service
  infrastructure serves tens of billions of requests annually with 99.99%
  uptime.
- **Accuracy.** We know that IP geolocation has its limitations and we strive to
  be as transparent as possible about our
  [accuracy numbers](https://www.maxmind.com/en/geoip2-city-accuracy-comparison)
  for both our free and paid solutions.
- **Accessibility.** [Our APIs are public](https://dev.maxmind.com/geoip/) and
  widely adopted which is why you have probably seen MaxMind integrated in some
  of the platforms you use, and probably why you know about us.
- **Flexibility.** If you need more accurate or other kinds of IP data all you
  need to do is switch out the URL to call one of our
  [paid web services](https://www.maxmind.com/en/geoip2-precision-services). We
  don’t require a subscription or commitment. You can pay as you go and service
  credits don’t expire.
