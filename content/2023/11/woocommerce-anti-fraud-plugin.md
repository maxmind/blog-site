The
[WooCommerce Anti-Fraud plugin](https://woocommerce.com/products/woocommerce-anti-fraud/?utm_source=maxmind&utm_medium=blog&utm_campaign=OPMC)
is one of the simplest and most effective ways for online retailers to avoid
losses from payment fraud.

Online payment fraud has kept pace with the rapid growth of sales, with
eCommerce fraud predicted by experts to exceed $107 billion in 2029.

The
[WooCommerce Anti-Fraud plugin](https://woocommerce.com/products/woocommerce-anti-fraud/?utm_source=maxmind&utm_medium=blog&utm_campaign=OPMC)
scans transactions in real time, allowing users to review—and catch—potentially
malicious transactions before processing them. It provides insightful dashboard
analytics, customizable fraud alerts, and automatic fraud prevention—among many
other features that help streamline sales and reduce the risk of fraud.

One feature that we’d like to highlight is the plugin’s integration with
MaxMind’s fraud detection API, the minFraud® service. Each transaction is
assessed by MaxMind’s minFraud service and assigned a risk score. The
integration can provide dozens of data points for fraud analysis including
email, billing address, the use of VPNs/anonymizers, IP addresses, geolocation,
and more.
