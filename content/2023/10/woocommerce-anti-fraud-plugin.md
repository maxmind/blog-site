The
[WooCommerce Anti-Fraud plugin](https://woocommerce.com/products/woocommerce-anti-fraud/?utm_source=maxmind&utm_medium=blog&utm_campaign=OPMC)
is one of the simplest and most effective ways for online retailers to avoid losses from payment fraud.

Online payment fraud has kept pace with the rapid growth of ecommerce sales. [One recent study by Juniper Research](https://www.juniperresearch.com/researchstore/fintech-payments/online-payment-fraud-research-report) found that, in 2023, ecommerce merchants lost $38 billion in revenue to online fraud. By 2028, losses are expected to reach $91 billion.

The [WooCommerce Anti-Fraud plugin](https://woocommerce.com/products/woocommerce-anti-fraud/?utm_source=maxmind&utm_medium=blog&utm_campaign=OPMC) scans transactions in real time, allowing users to review—and catch—potentially malicious transactions before processing them. It provides insightful dashboard analytics, customizable fraud alerts, and automatic fraud prevention—among many other features that help streamline sales and reduce the risk of fraud. 

One feature that we’d like to highlight is the plugin’s integration with MaxMind’s fraud detection API, the minFraud® service. Each transaction is assessed by MaxMind’s minFraud service and assigned a risk score. The integration can provide dozens of data points for fraud analysis including email, billing address, the use of VPNs/anonymizers, IP addresses, geolocation, and more.
