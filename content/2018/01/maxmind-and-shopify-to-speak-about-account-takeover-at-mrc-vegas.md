- **Level:** Advanced
- **Description**: _As more and more data breaches hit the news, account
takeover is a growing threat for online merchants. Even if fraudsters don’t get
clear-text usernames - emails, passwords, other sensitive information can
potentially be used for social engineering or other exploits. When it comes to
account takeover, online merchants face the added challenge of recognizing a
fraudster masquerading as a valued and trusted customer. Learn what geolocation
and other transactional data can do to help you understand the context of an
account takeover in order to identify suspicious activity and make better
decisions while providing your good customers with the best experience
possible._
