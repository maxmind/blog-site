- **Level:** Advanced
- **Description**: _As more and more data breaches hit the news, account
  takeover is a growing threat for online merchants. Even if fraudsters don’t
  get clear-text usernames - emails, passwords, other sensitive information can
  potentially be used for social engineering or other exploits. When it comes to
  account takeover, online merchants face the added challenge of recognizing a
  fraudster masquerading as a valued and trusted customer. Learn what
  geolocation and other transactional data can do to help you understand the
  context of an account takeover in order to identify suspicious activity and
  make better decisions while providing your good customers with the best
  experience possible._
