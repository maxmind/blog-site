Earlier this year, we announced our plans to discontinue the GeoLite Legacy
databases. As part of sharing that decision with you, we mentioned that we would
be removing latitude and longitude coordinates from the
[GeoLite2 databases](https://dev.maxmind.com/geoip/geolite2-free-geolocation-data/)
in 2019.

After careful consideration, taking into account customer feedback, we have
decided against removing latitude and longitude coordinates from the GeoLite2
databases. We are in the process of reviewing coordinates used in all of our
GeoLite2 and GeoIP databases to ensure there is no risk of misuse.

Moving forward, we will still be discontinuing the GeoLite Legacy databases and
will continue to support open source through our GeoLite2 databases. Please
continue to check our blog, Support Center, websites, and our
[Twitter](https://twitter.com/maxmind?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor)
and [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/maxmind) accounts for additional
updates on our review of GeoLite2 database coordinates.

At MaxMind, “open communication” is one of our core values. We’re listening to
you and we take your feedback seriously.

Additional information can also be found in our earlier blog:

_GeoLite2 databases are free IP geolocation databases comparable to, but less
accurate than, MaxMind’s GeoIP2 databases. Please remember to use the accuracy
radius if displaying coordinates on a map._
