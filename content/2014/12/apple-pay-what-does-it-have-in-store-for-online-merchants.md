In the world of accepting online payments, credit and debit cards are the
industry standard. And for good reason-- they’re convenient, and they’ve been
around for decades.

But while they’re the go-to payment option, merchants continue to struggle with
their vulnerability to fraud.

So that got us wondering-- at some point, the credit card was a new invention
and appeared to be the payment solution of the future. It was a paradigm shift
from the written bank check, which was itself an invention over cash and hard
currency. And each option has pushed us into a new era of thieves trying to
crank out a payday-- sometimes digital, sometimes physical.

So, what’s next for the digital age? Apple is hoping to introduce a new era with
Apple Pay. Does it have the moxie to move us beyond the credit card and
associated e-commerce fraud?

**Mobile payment: Apple Pay** You can’t tap your scroll wheel without clicking
through a headline for Apple Pay. And it makes sense-- digital-physical hybrid
payment options have been trying to take hold for several years now.

While Google and Microsoft have tried their hand at mobile payment methods,
Apple’s recent release of Apple Pay is the
[first to show encouraging signs](https://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/15/technology/apple-pay-gives-glimpse-of-mainstream-appeal-for-mobile-payments.html?emc=edit_tu_20141117&nl=technology&nlid=23993500&_r=1)
of nascent adoption. With the smartphone now ubiquitous, the ease of use at the
cash register for this type of payment method becomes more compelling.

Apple Pay has immediate benefits for merchants taking CNP payments as well.
Apple Pay incorporates fraud detection technology such as

Apple is banking on these features to make Apple Pay more attractive to
merchants, and is even going so far as to assume some of the risk of fraudulent
transactions themselves.

and provides a new opportunity for widespread use. But considering the amount of
consumer data and financial information involved, consumers and merchants alike
are sure to closely monitor what E-commerce fraud detection looks like as new

[NFC payment systems](https://www.cnet.com/how-to/how-nfc-works-and-mobile-payments/)
are incorporating unique digital signatures and Apple Pay is

thwart fraud. At the same time, Apple Pay and other mobile payment options are
really no more than glorified credit cards. Is the new technology real progress,
or will the fraudsters just step up their game? Adaptation of the new payment
methods will be slow, so it will be some time before we can tell.
