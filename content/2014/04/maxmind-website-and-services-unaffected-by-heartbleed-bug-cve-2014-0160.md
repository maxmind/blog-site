MaxMind’s website and services were unaffected by the recently announced
[Heartbleed bug](https://www.heartbleed.com) in the OpenSSL cryptographic
software library.

The discovery of the Heartbleed bug means your encrypted connections with
websites that used particular versions of the OpenSSL library (versions
1.0.1-1.0.1f and 1.0.2-beta1) may have been compromised, exposing your logins,
passwords, and other data. MaxMind does not use a vulnerable version of the
OpenSSL library on internet-facing servers. So you need not worry that your
credentials or data were compromised.

This
[article on ReadWrite](https://readwrite.com/heartbleed-openssl-bug-cryptography-web-security/)
describes the bug in more detail as well as what to do to determine if your
servers are vulnerable and how to protect yourself personally.

We strongly recommend you change your passwords on any sites affected by the
bug. You should assume a site was affected unless you hear otherwise.
[Mashable](https://mashable.com/archive/heartbleed-bug-websites-affected) and
