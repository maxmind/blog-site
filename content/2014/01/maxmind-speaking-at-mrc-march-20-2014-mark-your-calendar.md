MaxMind, the industry-leading provider of IP intelligence and online fraud
detection tools, has been invited to present at the 2014 Merchant Risk Council
(MRC) eCommerce Payments & Risk Conference in Las Vegas. We are excited to be
joined by a top Risk Analyst from our merchant partner, Shopify, the leading
commerce platform that allows anyone to easily sell online, at their retail
location, and everywhere in between.

Together, we will be presenting:

_**Proxies and Merchants and Fraudsters ... Oh My!**_ Combating Fraud: Detecting
Proxies and Other High Risk IPs

In this presentation, we will explain the methods that criminals are using to
thwart traditional proxy detection techniques. Then we will examine the new
strategies that Shopify and MaxMind have implemented to detect and identify
these types of fraudulent orders.

Merchants attending this presentation will learn how to identify vulnerabilities
in their control environment that result from new trends that we’ve observed
while monitoring the methods that criminals are deploying to prevent merchants
from accurately detecting high risk proxy servers.

**Mark Your Calendar!** March 20, 2014 3:05 - 4:05 pm PT Aria Resort, Las Vegas
