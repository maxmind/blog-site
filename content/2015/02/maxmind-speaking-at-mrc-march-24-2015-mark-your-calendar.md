## Manual Review Best Practices _Learnings from Peak Buying Times in 2014_

We invite you to attend this panel discussion to learn more about best practices
for preparing for, executing and evaluating your manual review processes. You’ll
benefit by hearing specific examples of unique situations and fraud trends that
caused online merchants to alter their tools or procedures. You’ll also have the
chance to review some questionable transactions and engage in discussion about
whether to approve or reject them.

**Mark Your Calendar!** March 24, 2015 1:30 p.m. – 2:15 p.m. PT Aria Resort, Las
Vegas

We hope to see you at the Presentation or just stop by booth #422 and say,
