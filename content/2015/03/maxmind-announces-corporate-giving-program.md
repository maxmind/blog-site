MaxMind is pleased to announce our corporate giving program - we plan to give
away over 50% of our profits to charity.

Since its inception, MaxMind has focused on creating value for our customers,
especially where the ratio of value to effort is high. It is exciting how
technology enables us to write code once and deploy it to thousands of customers
to solve problems. For marketing, we focus on strategies that have high impact
per dollar invested, including detailed, transparent information about our
products on our website and our freemium model for geolocation databases.

Similarly, with charitable giving, we look for opportunities to apply research
to find how our funding can have high impact per dollar invested. Sometimes the
most cost-effective program can be surprising. For example, according to MITâ€™s
Abdul Latif Jameel
[Poverty Action Lab](https://www.povertyactionlab.org/policy-lessons/education/improving-student-participation),
deworming may be one of the most effective ways to increase student
participation in school.

The for-profit space seems more and more crowded with great companies pursuing
great ideas. There appears to be no shortage of angel and venture capital for
technology startups, and competition is intense. On the other hand, the
non-profit space appears a lot less crowded, as there are fewer funders pursuing
innovative solutions.

We would like to thank our customers for making this possible!
