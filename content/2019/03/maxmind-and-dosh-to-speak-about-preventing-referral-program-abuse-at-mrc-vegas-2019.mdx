Effective affiliate programs based on social referrals can drive tremendous user acquisition and sales growth for your business. In many cases, referred users can be a very valuable source of growth. However, when incentives come into play and digital payouts are on the line, your new user acquisition channel can quickly become a lucrative target for abuse. Hear Dosh's story of rapid growth in good users - and risky ones - when the referral floodgates opened and new users per day increased by 1000-2000%. Ultimately, Dosh was able to optimize its referral program and control this risk vector, allowing it to scale up from a scrappy startup with a few thousand customers to a leader in its space with millions of customers. In this session, you will learn about the economics of consumer referral programs and how to keep abusers out with the power of data.

**Takeaways**

1. Differentiate between different types of consumer affiliate program abuse;
2. Understand the economics of consumer affiliate program abuse and learn how to identify it; and
3. Identify the appropriate controls to manage and mitigate consumer affiliate program abuse
