Effective affiliate programs based on social referrals can drive tremendous user
acquisition and sales growth for your business. In many cases, referred users
can be a very valuable source of growth. However, when incentives come into play
and digital payouts are on the line, your new user acquisition channel can
quickly become a lucrative target for abuse. Hear Dosh's story of rapid growth
in good users - and risky ones - when the referral floodgates opened and new
users per day increased by 1000-2000%. Ultimately, Dosh was able to optimize its
referral program and control this risk vector, allowing it to scale up from a
scrappy startup with a few thousand customers to a leader in its space with
millions of customers. In this session, you will learn about the economics of
consumer referral programs and how to keep abusers out with the power of data.
