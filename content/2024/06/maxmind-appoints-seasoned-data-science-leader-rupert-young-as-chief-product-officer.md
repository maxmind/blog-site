Rupert Young’s cross-disciplinary career in machine learning, fraud and
security, and data science began with stamps.

After his grandfather gifted Rupert an album containing thousands of stamps,
Rupert—then only a teenager —built several databases to catalog his collection
and identify trends in watermarks, colors, cancel types, perforations, printing
techniques, and plate redesigns.

This passion project on stamps inspired Rupert’s college application essay,
which gained him admission to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT).
Rupert graduated from MIT with a Bachelor of Science degree and a Master of
Science degree in Computer Science and Electrical Engineering.

A technology and business-savvy leader with decades of industry experience,
Rupert has held key roles in product, engineering, and business development at
companies such as Neustar, AT&T, and most recently F5, where he was in charge of
fraud and risk products. Over the last 15 years, Rupert has also worked closely
with data science teams to uncover insights about—and for—customers.

As MaxMind’s Chief Product Officer, Rupert will be undertaking a number of
strategic initiatives to accelerate product innovation.

“One of my immediate goals at MaxMind is to take our market-leading IP data
products in new directions to help our customers with their security, fraud,
marketing, and localization problems. As a complementary approach, we intend to
develop new partnerships and channels to bring exciting joint offerings to
customers.”
