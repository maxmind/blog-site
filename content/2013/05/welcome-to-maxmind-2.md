Hello and welcome to MaxMind's official blog. This blog will provide you with
valuable information, whether you’re a MaxMind customer or not.

Our blog will primarily cover IP geolocation and the prevention of online fraud.
We will address these topics from both technical and non-technical viewpoints.
On occasion, we will also share status updates on what we are working on here at
MaxMind. We appreciate your feedback and would love to hear about what you'd
like to see on our blog.

## MaxMind in a Nutshell

We are a tech-driven, customer-focused company committed to providing great
products and services. We want to build the the best IP geolocation and fraud
detection systems in the industry and make them available to everyone.

We keep our prices low and our sales process simple. You can visit our website
right now and sign up for any of our products. There’s no lengthy sales process,
just a simple web form. You don’t have to talk to a sales person, though we’d
love to hear from you. We’re happy to talk to you via email or online chat if
you have questions.

We make our services as easy to use as possible. All of our web services are
clearly documented on our [developer website](https://dev.maxmind.com). We also
believe in open source. You can follow us on
[GitHub](https://github.com/maxmind/), where we publish our client APIs, as well
as the spec and creation tools for our new IP database format.

Watch this space! You can also follow us on Twitter as
